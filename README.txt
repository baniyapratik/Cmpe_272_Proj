<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
<strong>Scope:</strong> <br/>
Our design may be a Distributed Active Climate Control System for large data centers. The server racks are laid out in grids with cooling units and lighting units (for maintenance and operation). <br/>

<strong>Our system would utilize distributed low cost IoT sensors to perform these tasks including: </strong> <br/>
- Ambient Temperature Monitoring <br/>
- HVAC Control (Small servo used to showcase fan operation) <br/>
- Motion Sensing <br/>
- Lighting Control <br/><br/>
<strong>Features: </strong><br/>
- Raspberry Pi Computing Module (Parent Node/Stand alone) <br/>
- WiFi MicroController (Optional for increased complexity) (Child Node/Stand alone IFFT Device) <br/>
- Redundancy and node failover i.e. all nodes communicate at all times <br/>
- Constrain Resolver to distribute communication load among nodes to balance traffic <br/>
